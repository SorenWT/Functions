function condSequence = carryoverCounterbalance_SWT(numConds,cbOrder,reps,omitSelfAdjacencies,adjmatrix)
%
%When using this function/code in academic research, please cite:
%Brooks, J.L. (2012). Counterbalancing for serial order carryover effects in
%experimental condition orders. Psychological Methods.
%
%Creates a serial-order counterbalanced sequence of conditions, i.e. it ensures
%that every condition is preceded equally often by every other condition (first-order)
%or every nTuple of length n for nth-order counterbalancing. This can be
%done for any number of conditions. Uses Kandel et al. 1996 method to
%determine Euler path (see accessory functions included below).
%
%OUTPUT:
%-condSequence: the counterbalanced sequence. Length will depend on
%parameters. Output as an array of numbers
%
%INPUTS:
%-numConds: number of unique conditions. Must be a positive integer
%
%-cbOrder: depth/order of counterbalancing. Must be a positive integer.
%First-order counterbalancing ensures that every condition is preceded by
%every other condition equally often. nth-order counterbalancing ensures
%that every condition is preceded equally often by every n-length sequence
%(nTuple) of conditions. e.g. 2nd-order counterbalancing would ensure that
%condition 1 is preceded equally often by each set of 2 conditions,
%1 1, 1 2, 2 1, 2 2.
%
%-reps: The number of times each condition is preceded by every other
%condition (first-order) or every nTuple (nth-order). Must be a positive
%integer. This can be used to increase the total number of trials while
%maintaining counterbalancing.
%
%-omitSelfAdjacencies: 0 = include condition self-adjacencies (e.g. 2 2 1 2 1 1 2);
%1 = exclude condition self-adjacencies (e.g. 1 2 1 2 1 2)

function [seq] = eulerPathKandelMethod_carryoverCounterbalance(adjacencyMatrix)
% Finds an Euler circuit through a graph, G, and returns sequence of nodes
% associated with that path. Based on method by Kandel, et al. (1996).
% The circuit/path created is uniformly drawn from the set of all possible
% Eulerian circuits of G.
%
% USAGE:
% [seq] = eulerPathKandelMethod(adjacencyMatrix)
% OUTPUT: seq is a ordered sequence of nodes corresponding to the circuit
% through G.
%
% INPUT: adjacency matrix
% Option1: If entering a single integer, n, then program assumes a
% fully-connected digraph with n nodes and 1 instance of the edge
% between each node.
% Option2: If entering a matrix then the matrix will be
% treated as the adjacency matrix of the graph, G. Must be an nxn matrix for
% a graph with n nodes Dimension1 = represents the
% node sending the directed edge, e.g. G(1,2) is an entry
% representing a directed edge from node 1 to node 2.
%
% - adjacency matrix must be consistent with an Eulerian graph,
% i.e., all nodes have in-degree = out-degree.
% Semi-Eulerian graphs are not valid for this program.
% - all entries in the adjacency matrix must be >= 0. Values
% larger than one indicate duplicated instances of an edge between
% the nodes.
