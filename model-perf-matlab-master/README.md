Calculate statistics evaluating the performance of binary or continuous predictions output from a model

The statistics calculated for binary predictions include the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC), Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic, Efron's pseudo R squared, the sum of squares R squared, operating point statistics including sensitivity, positive predictive value, specificity, negative predictive value and others.
